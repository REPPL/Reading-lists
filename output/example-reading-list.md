**This is an example reading list.**

# Reading list

The following list documents what I have read on the topic and felt
worth keeping a record of. While I haven’t added anything I didn’t find
useful in one way or another, many of the sources listed here may not be
of interest to many people.

*(This page remains work in progress. I use keywords to generate
headings and sub-headings for this list. I often assign more than one
keyword to a source, which I do on purpose. What I don’t do on purpose
is attached the wrong keyword to a source. But it happens, with the
consequence that a source ends up under a headline it doesn’t belong to.
I remain hopeful that I will spot these mistakes over time. Please
